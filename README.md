# Instructions
Before you use this fix, it is important that you run the launcher.exe and set the resolution within the launcher to 800 x 600. This must be done for the fix to work properly.

Go to releases download the zip for the fix you wish to use extract it and copy the d3d9.dll and d3d9.ini into your game folder and make sure to follow the step above! (\Activision\Shrek 2 Team Action\Game) next to the shrek2.exe and you are good to go!

To get the launcher.exe to work you need to go to the Shrek 2: Team Action folder where you see files called Launcher.exe and shrk2tma.ico. Delete the Launcher.exe (88kb) file then go into the folder (Game) and copy the Launcher.exe (496kb) file and copy that back into the first location Shrek 2: Team Action. The launcher will now work properly with the fix, use the Launcher.exe from the first location Shrek 2: Team Action where you see shrk2tma.ico. If you made a desktop shortcut when installing the game, you can use that instead.

# Settings
You can edit the settings you wish to use in the d3d9.ini file.

# Resolution
Default for resolution in the d3d9.ini file is (1920 x 1080) you can set Width and Height as you need within the d3d9.ini file. The aspect ratio is auto calculated.

# FOV
Default for FOV is (0) original - this can be set in the ini as follows: 0 = off/original game FOV, 1 = 16:10, 2 = 16:9, 3 = 21:9 and 4 = eyefinity/ surround.

# FPS
This game uses an FPS toggle feature. This is required to be able to play the game properly and allow the player to complete certain parts of the game that break on any FPS higher than 37.5fps. There are 2 versions of the fix for FPS one which allows the user to use a button of their choice for the toggle feature. The other version sets the key ‘P’ to the toggle key by default. These are explained below.
# Shrek 2 Team Action Fix
The FPS can be toggled with any key in the game. There will be a message box that will pop up before the game launches which will give you instructions on what you must do. Click OK on the first pop up message box, then click any button on your keyboard or mouse and it will then confirm the button choice and launch the game. Then in the game you can use the key you have selected to toggle between 37.5 and your chosen FPS within the game at any time.
# Shrek 2 Team Action Fix - NoMessageBox
This version has no message box asking you to choose a key before launching the game. The FPS toggle key will always be ‘P’ on the keyboard.
